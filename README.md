Pricing-options-with-machine-learning
Using machine learning algorithms to forecast the prices of put option instruments. 

Although many Finance students have learned the fundamentals of options pricing, the reality is a tad bit different. With sophisticated models used by the biggest institutions and independent traders around the world, the art has a newly added element: Machine Learning. By using methods popular in the realm of Data Science, we can employ advanced techniques to predict the prices of financial instruments, particularly vanilla put options

Although the pricing of options has traditionally been determined via the Blach-Scholes model, in recent times, there have been instances where these models failed to stand the test of time and have been challenged. Therefore, using neural networks (nn) can assist in situations where the discrepancy can be reduced between values determined by the traditional and foundational model and through random forests, which in our case, turned out to be the best form of network being able to capture the complex relationships and intracacies.
